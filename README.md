# EXERCISE 1 - Git

### Author: Jea Anne Gadil

### Section: UV-7L

## Description
    GitHub Page creation with three (3) branches namely main, favorites, and another. In the main branch, my name, nickname, and photo were added. Afterwards, the information about my favorites were added in the favorites branch which was merged to the main branch so that the information will be seen on the website live. Lastly, another branch is composed of details about my hobby and childhood dream but it was not seen live on the website as it is not merged to the main branch.

## Challenges when developing the exercise
    -I kind of had a hard time understanding the branches. I felt lost when I first created the 'favorites' branch but after I deeply understand how it works, I realize the benefits of using that feature.
    -Since this is my first time encountering the HTML and CSS, I needed to review its syntax and how I am able to connect css with it. It went smooth along the way.
