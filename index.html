                <p>My favorite CMSC subject so far is CMSC 127 since all of the exercises are by group. <br> With that, we can interact with each other</p>
                <br>
                <p>On the other hand, my favorite GE is AMAT 19 because I love the topics <br> and I'm with my friends</p>
                <br>
                <p>Out of all the programming languages that I've encountered, I would say the C is my favorite because the syntax is very simple and programmer-friendly.</p>
                <br>
                <p>I would say that learning Computer Science is really hard so my go-to food <br> whenever I am stressed is chicken burger from McDonalds.</p>
