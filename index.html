	EXERCISE 1	- Git
	Author: Jea Anne Gadil
	Section: UV-7L

	Description:
		GitHub Page creation with three (3) branches namely main, favorites, and another. In the main branch, my name, nickname, and photo were added.
		Afterwards, the information about my favorites were added in the favorites branch which was merged to the main branch so that the information 
		will be seen on the website live. Lastly, another branch is composed of details about my hobby and childhood dream but it was not seen live on
		the website as it is not merged to the main branch.

                <p>My favorite CMSC subject so far is CMSC 127 since all of the exercises are by group. <br> With that, we can interact with each other</p>
                <br>
                <p>On the other hand, my favorite GE is AMAT 19 because I love the topics <br> and I'm with my friends</p>

                <p>Out of all the programming languages that I've encountered, I would say the C is my favorite because the syntax is very simple and programmer-friendly.</p>
                <br>
                <p>I would say that learning Computer Science is really hard so my go-to food <br> whenever I am stressed is chicken burger from McDonalds.</p>
